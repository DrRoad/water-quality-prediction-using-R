DO       
For predicting DO using BOD and Temperature best is LASSO(6.558347)
Overall best is step wise (6.655898)
By analysing and applying regression we found although theoretically DO(dissolved oxygen) depends upon BOD(biological oxygen demand) and temperature but practically it depends on a lot of other factors.           
Nitrate     
Multiple Linear Regression is best(1.446844)                       
Ph         
Best is Linear Regression.(Since adjusted R square is more and residual standard error is less)
